Things to add:

1. Finish line - DONE
2. parent menu that loads levels
3. In-game dialogs: "Press Shift to fire, arrow keys to move, etc." - DONE
4. More objects and structures, possibly ones with themes. Maybe traffic cones or ice?
5. Starting in level 2, add the concept of an enemy
6. "level 0" : a short, easy walkthrough level that introduces basic concepts and uses the in-game toast dialogs - DONE
7. add ending animation for level completion

Ok, GameObject and Game can both emit things and listen to things. Here is (possibly) how I will differentiate.

Game will listen for global events that directly impact the level, removing the level, or changing the level.
i.e. pause, death, level-completion, restart

GameObject event emitters deal with interactions between active objects in a game level. i.e. accelerate, hit,
lower health, etc
